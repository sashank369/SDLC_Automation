#### 3. UX Principles Document

**Accessibility Considerations:**
- All form fields must have labels associated with them to support screen readers.
- The registration form will have sufficient color contrast ratios to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.
- Use of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to provide additional context for assistive technologies.

**Responsive Design:**
- The layout will adjust elegantly for mobile devices, ensuring that form fields are easily tappable and readable without horizontal scrolling.

**Real-Time Validation:**
- As users fill out each field, real-time feedback will indicate whether input requirements are met. For instance, the password strength meter will update dynamically as users type.

**Error Handling:**
- Clear error messages will be placed directly beneath each problematic field, highlighting what correction is required. Messages will be concise yet informative (e.g., “Email is already in use,” “Password must contain at least one special character”).

**User Empowerment:**
- By incorporating a “Show Password” toggle, users can opt to view their password to ensure correctness. This reduces frustration during set up.

**Privacy Compliance:**
- Users will be informed about data storage and compliance through a brief statement near the submit button, assuring them of their data protection rights.

## Backend Architecture

### Database Schema

For the user registration backend, we will set up a MySQL database with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(20),
    subscribe_newsletter TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0,
    accept_terms TINYINT(1) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Explanation:
- `user_id`: A unique identifier for the user.
- `full_name`: Stores the full name of the user, with a length constraint.
- `email`: Must be unique across the database to avoid duplicates.
- `password`: Stores the user's password. Ensure that although bcrypt encryption is not used, security measures for password storage need to be implemented.
- `phone_number`: Optional field in the specified format.
- `subscribe_newsletter`: Optional field, defaults to false.
- `accept_terms`: Boolean indicating if the user accepted the terms, and it is mandatory.
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamp fields to track record creation and updates.

### Backend Service Details

The backend service will be implemented using a popular framework (e.g., Express.js for Node.js or Flask for Python). The following describes the necessary components and logic:

1. **Setup an Express Server**:
   - API route for registration: `/v1/register`.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate incoming requests against the defined requirements (e.g., regex for email, password strength checking).
   - Use libraries such as Joi or express-validator for validation.

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Use middleware like `express-rate-limit` to impose a rate limit of 10 requests per minute.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Create a centralized error handler to intercept and format errors according to the API contract.
   
5. **Registration Logic**:
   - On receiving a registration request:
     - Validate input data and respond with appropriate error messages if validation fails.
     - Check if the email is already in use.
     - If validation passes, hash the password before saving (even though bcrypt is not used, implement a secure hashing approach).
     - Insert new user data into the database.
     - Return success response with userId and redirectUrl.

6. **Compliance**:
   - Ensure the service is compliant with GDPR by having a clear data usage policy.
   - Provide data usage statements in the success response.

### API Integration Strategies

To ensure a smooth integration with the frontend or other services, follow these guidelines:

1. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman.
   - Include examples of requests and responses alongside failure scenarios.

2. **CORS Handling**:
   - Ensure proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers are set to allow frontend applications to interact with the API.

3. **Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for individual components (validation, database actions).
   - Integrate tests for the registration endpoint to cover all scenarios: valid and invalid requests, ensuring full coverage of potential errors.
   - Use frameworks like Jest for JavaScript or PyTest for Python.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Integrate a monitoring solution like Prometheus or use logging libraries (e.g., Winston for Node.js) to capture the API performance and errors in production.

### Example Request and Response

**Sample Request**:

```json
POST https://api.example.com/v1/register
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword1!",
  "confirmPassword": "SecurePassword1!",
  "phoneNumber": "+11234567890",
  "subscribeNewsletter": true,
  "acceptTerms": true
}
```

**Successful Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Registration successful",
  "userId": "1",
  "redirectUrl": "https://example.com/welcome"
}
```

**Validation Error Response**:
```json
{
  "errors": {
    "fullName": "Full name must be at least 2 characters",
    "email": "Email is already in use",
    "password": "Password must include at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character",
    "confirmPassword": "Passwords do not match",
    "phoneNumber": "Phone number format is invalid",
    "acceptTerms": "You must accept the terms and conditions"
  }
}
```

By following this structure and maintaining best practices, the backend architecture for user registration will be robust, secure, and user-friendly, ensuring a great experience for every new user.
