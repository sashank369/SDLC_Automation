## User Requirements

**User Registration Flow Requirements Document**

**Introduction:**
The purpose of this document is to outline the key user requirements for the registration flow of our platform. The goal is to ensure a streamlined and efficient registration process, focusing on essential fields only to maximize user experience and conversion rates.

**User Registration Requirements:**

1. **User Interface Requirements:**
   - The registration interface must be intuitive and accessible, utilizing responsive design to ensure usability across various devices and screen sizes.
   - Steps in the registration process should be clearly labeled and provide real-time feedback to users, such as error messages or confirmation of successful field completion.

2. **Mandatory Fields:**
   - **Full Name:** Collect the user's first and last name separately, allowing straightforward retrieval and addressing of users.
   - **Email Address:** An essential field used for account verification and communication. It must be validated for proper format and uniqueness within the system.
   - **Password:** A user-defined password, adhering to security best practices (minimum of 8 characters, including numbers, uppercase, and a special character). A password strength indicator should be present.
   - **Terms and Conditions Agreement:** Users must explicitly agree to the terms and conditions and privacy policy, typically through a checkbox that links to these documents.
   - **Captcha Verification:** To prevent automated signups or spam, implementing a CAPTCHA system can help ensure registrations are being completed by actual individuals.

3. **Optional Fields:**
   - **Phone Number:** This should be optional for users who wish to set up additional security measures or prefer communication via SMS.
   - **Date of Birth:** Optional, with the purpose of personalization and age verification where necessary.

4. **Accessibility Requirements:**
   - Ensure that all text fields and interface elements are accessible via screen readers and keyboard navigation for users with disabilities.
   - Provide sufficient contrast and clear visibility for text and interface elements.

5. **Security Requirements:**
   - Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission during registration.
   - Ensure data storage complies with best practices for security and privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.

6. **Post-Registration Requirements:**
   - Users should receive a confirmation email upon successful registration, containing a link to verify their account.
   - Offer an option to link accounts with social media platforms (e.g., Sign up with Google or Facebook) for a faster registration process.

**Conclusion:**
This document outlines the core and optional requirements for the user registration flow, aiming to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly registration process. Feedback loops, such as user testing and support channels, should be in place for continual improvement based on user experience and needs.

### General Considerations
- All inputs should be sanitized and validated to ensure security and robustness.
- Invalid requests should return clear messages to refine user experience based on real-time feedback.
- Ensure compliance with GDPR & CCPA for storing and handling user data.
- Use structured logging to monitor API usage and capture potential issues for continuous improvement. 

By implementing these API specifications, the registration process is designed to be comprehensive and user-centric while maintaining high-security standards and aligning with modern UX principles.

## Backend Architecture

### Database Schema

1. **Users Table**
   - **id**: Primary key, UUID
   - **first_name**: VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL
   - **last_name**: VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL
   - **email**: VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL, UNIQUE
   - **password**: VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL
   - **created_at**: TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT current_timestamp
   - **updated_at**: TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT current_timestamp on update current_timestamp
   - **phone_number**: VARCHAR(15), NULL
   - **date_of_birth**: DATE, NULL
   - **email_verified**: BOOLEAN, DEFAULT false
   - **email_verification_token**: VARCHAR(255), NULL
   - **terms_agreed**: BOOLEAN, DEFAULT false

2. **SocialMediaLinks Table**
   - **id**: Primary key, UUID
   - **user_id**: Foreign Key, REFERENCES Users(id)
   - **provider**: ENUM('google', 'facebook', etc.), NOT NULL
   - **access_token**: TEXT, NOT NULL
   - **created_at**: TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT current_timestamp

### Backend Service Details

- **Programming Language**: Use Node.js or Python for backend services to handle the API logic.
- **Framework**: Use Express.js for Node.js or Flask/Django for Python for routing and middleware handling.
- **Security**: Store passwords securely using a strong hashing function such as Argon2 (avoiding bcrypt as per constraints). Implement HTTPS and sanitation libraries like DOMPurify for input validation.

### API Integration Strategies

1. **User Registration Endpoint**
   - Implement password hashing with Argon2 when storing the password.
   - Ensure the email is unique using database constraints.
   - Generate and send email verification tokens upon successful registration.

2. **Captcha and Agreement Verification**
   - Validate captcha token using third-party service validation calls.
   - On successful validation, update the `terms_agreed` field in the Users table.

3. **Email Verification**
   - Generate and validate a secure token stored in `email_verification_token`.
   - On email confirmation (token validation), set `email_verified` to true.

4. **Social Media Linking**
   - Use OAuth 2.0 for social media login integrations.
   - On successful OAuth token validation, update the SocialMediaLinks table with linked account details.

### Additional Considerations

- Implement rate limiting and IP whitelisting on sensitive endpoints.
- Use JWT tokens for authentication on protected routes, ensuring token revocation capabilities.
- Log all registration and user activity using a tool like ELK stack for monitoring and auditing.
- Apply GDPR/CCPA data handling standards ensuring the ability to delete or access all user data upon request.

These detailed backend structural and integration strategies will ensure a robust, scalable, and secure user registration system in alignment with the specified API specifications.
